## The 7 trickiest French letters to pronounce – and how to master them

We know from experience there are a few extra tricky letters of the French alphabet that can be hard for English speakers to say. So let’s take a look at them:

1. E

Pronounce the ‘e’ like “euh”. Think of the sound you would make if you saw something disgusting!

2. G

If the letter ‘g’ appears before an ‘e’ or an ‘i’ (like genou), pronounce it softly, like “jeh” – and try stretching out the ‘j’ slightly. It can help to think of the sound at the start of the name Jerry.

But if the letter ‘g’ appears before a ‘u’, ‘o’, ‘a’ or consonant (like grenouille), the sound you need to make is harder. Think about the sound at the start of the name of Jerry’s best friend, Greg.

3. I

Pronounce the ‘i’ like “ee”, using a long ‘e’ sound, as in see or bee.

4. J

The letter ‘j’ is pronounced like "jhee”. 
This is similar to the English pronunciation of the letter ‘g’, but with an “ee” sound instead of an “ay” sound at the end.


5. U

U is probably the hardest letter to pronounce as it’s not a sound we have in the English language. 
Try saying the letter ‘u’, but close your mouth, too, as if you’re ‘EE’. The correct ‘e-yooh’ sound should come… fairly naturally.

6. Y

The French ‘y’ is very different from the English letter.

It is pronounced like "ee-greck” with two distinct sounds. It is pronounced like a two-syllable word, so don’t pause between the two parts.

7. Œ

This digraph is pronounced like ‘oeh’. But you may hear it called e dans l’o, meaning “the e inside the o”. When used in a word, it normally takes the sound of the letter that follows it.

## How many vowels in the French alphabet?

French has six vowels, and 20 consonants. Y is considered a vowel, unlike in English, where it is classed as a consonant.
